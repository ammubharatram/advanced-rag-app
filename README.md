## Advanced RAG Application with LangGraph

Welcome to the repository for building an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application using LangGraph. This project demonstrates how to create an adaptive and self-reflective RAG system while preventing hallucinations. It also showcases the integration of an agent that retrieves information via a search browser using Tavily and leverages GROQ to speedup inference.
